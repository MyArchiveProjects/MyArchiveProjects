> I suck at Python, JS, C++, Java, Bash and more. Still building random stuff that sometimes works.

## ⚙️ About Me

- 💻 Self-taught dev just making random chaotic things
- 🔥 Coding with 1% logic, 99% chaos
- 📦 Proud Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V engineer
- 🧠 Forget everything right after Googling it
- 🎮 Sometimes I code, sometimes I stare at the code

---

## 🛠 Languages I touch (badly):

`Python` `JavaScript` `C++` `Bash` `Java` `HTML` `CSS` `SQL` `JSON` `YAML`  
> I don’t master any, I just fight them all.

---

## 🔧 Tools I sometimes use:

- VS Code (to suffer in color)
- Linux Terminal (to pretend I know what I’m doing)
- Git (aka “oops, reverted everything”)
- ChatGPT (because my brain gave up)
- Stack Overflow (obviously)

## 🧪 My Vibe

```txt
[+] Write code
[!] Break everything
[?] Panic
[>] Google error
[+] Copy solution from random forum
[+] It works (somehow)
```

## 💾 Current Projects

- 🖥 **[host-me](https://github.com/MyArchiveProjects/host-me)** — Instant local server launcher  
- 💻 Discord bots, CLI tools, fake APIs, broken GUIs and cursed scripts  
- 🧨 Expect nothing, be surprised if it runs

---

## 🔥 My Coding Philosophy

- Build first, understand later
- If it works, don't touch it
- If it breaks, blame the OS
- Don't fix warnings, just suppress them
- Code is temporary, chaos is eternal

- 🧩 I never finish a project, but I start 10 new ones

## 🤙 Contact

I don't do email. I don't do serious DMs. Just follow my mess here on GitHub or fork stuff.

## 🐾 Final Words

> Not here to impress. Just vibin’, coding, uploading, crashing, repeating.

**Peace.**
